    "### Working on the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `project.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",
    "* **For the Checkpoint, which is required, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for Questions 1-4!**\n",
    "    - The \"Project 3 Checkpoint\" autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code – it only runs the public tests on Questions 1-4 to make sure that you have completed them. There are no hidden tests for the checkpoint, and you will see your score upon submission. \n",
    "    - When you submit the final version of the project, however, we will use hidden tests to check your answers more thoroughly.\n",
    "    - Note that this means you will ultimately have to submit the project twice – once to the \"Project 3 Checkpoint\" autograder (Questions 1-4 only), and once to the \"Project 3\" autograder (once you're fully done).\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in `project.py` file!** The functions in `project.py` are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-wi).\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `project.py`, we've included a script named `project-validation.py` in the project folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the project, as long as they also end up in `project.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning! 🚨\n",
    "\n",
    "Many questions in the project intentionally build off of each other and the final result matters! In fact, you can \"get a question correct,\" but only receive partial credit for it because a previous answer was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with a Partner 👯\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate parts independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you do work with a partner, you and your partner must submit the Checkpoint together and the whole project together. See [here](https://dsc80.com/syllabus/#projects) for more details.\n"

    "## About the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Language Models (LMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "You've almost certainly heard about ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to generate human-like responses to natural language input.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"imgs/chatgpt.png\" width=60%>Inception!</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build your own [language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model), using publicly-available books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given collection of texts, known as a \"corpus.\" For instance, a language model can assign probabilities to the sentences `'when I drink Coke I smile'` and `'when I drink pizza I smile'`. One would expect the former sentence to have a higher probability than the former 😊.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all statistical models, the true data generating process is unknown to us, so all we can do is **estimate** the probabilities of sentences. For example, one might estimate the probability of a sentence as simply the product of the empirical probabilities (i.e., the number of times a word is observed in a dataset divided by the number of words in that dataset). In the above example, we may have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at several estimation methods in this project (including the one above); as you'll see, some are more sophisticated than others. Don't worry – we'll re-introduce all of the relevant mathematics as it becomes necessary throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing a Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a language model on a corpus, we must break the corpus into a sequence of words. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*, which may include punctuation and other terms. The process of separating a corpus into its tokens is called **tokenization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few examples of tokens that aren't \"words\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. appear right before a `'.'`), while other words tend to begin sentences (i.e. appear right after a `'.'`).\n",
    "* We have special \"START\" and \"END\" tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create your language model. Thus, you will use two ASCII hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `'\\x02'`, which refers to the \"beginning of text\".\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `'\\x03'`, which refers to the \"end of text\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Your Work for Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a language model, you will need to perform several steps, from data cleaning to implementing mathematical formulas. **Things will get messy, and it can be difficult to assess the correctness of your work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `grader.check` public notebook tests will be informative, but as per usual, they won't guarantee that your code is correct.\n",
    "- Run your functions on **real books** taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and make sure that their behavior looks correct. After selecting a book ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68085/)), click the \"Plain Text UTF-8\" link to find the book's text ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68085/pg68085.txt))."

for a\\nvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be\\nprose to a modern ear.\\n\\nThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally\\na deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient\\nreason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,\\nhowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted\\nfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.\\n\\nThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike\\nthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he\\nhopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of\\nEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the\\nmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;\\nand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow\\neven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of\\nHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the\\nhearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.\\n\\nIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been\\nused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of\\nthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.\\n\\nPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf\\nshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe\\nto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold\\nto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is\\njustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,\\nseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it\\nproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and\\nHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,\\nagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be\\ninterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear\\nwhat has been beautifully called \"the clanging tread of a warrior in\\nmail\"?\\n\\n[viii]\\n\\nOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone\\ngives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great\\nTeutonic epic.\\n\\nThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a\\nreproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences\\nclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking\\npoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as\\nmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular\\ncadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought\\nthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has\\nbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some\\nwarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for\\ninternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)\\n\\nWhat Gummere[1] calls the \"rime-giver\" has been studiously kept; _viz._,\\nthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the\\nalliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only\\nsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the\\noriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)\\n\\nNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally\\nafter a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,\\nSievers\\'s C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of\\ntranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and\\na variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |\\nx / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives\\nfurther variety to the types used in the translation.\\n\\nThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,\\n1_16 and 1_17: \"Lord\" and \"Wielder of Glory\"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and\\n2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been\\nsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.\\n\\nThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the\\ntranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have\\nbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are\\nnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.\\n\\n[ix]\\n\\nWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of\\nthe story of the poem.\\n\\n\\n_THE STORY._\\n\\n_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or\\npalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.\\nThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the\\nmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of\\njoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and\\nanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after\\nthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong\\nenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he\\npersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._\\n\\n_Over sea, a day\\'s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,\\nking of the Geats, hears of Grendel\\'s doings and of Hrothgar\\'s misery. He\\nresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With\\nfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that\\ncountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours\\nthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When\\nHrothgar\\'s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling\\nhim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his\\npalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._\\n\\n_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God\\'s anger. He seizes\\nand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.\\nA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,\\nboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears\\nGrendel\\'s shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,\\nhowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._\\n\\n_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall\\nHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and\\nhis retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._\\n\\n_Grendel\\'s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She\\nis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart\\n[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar\\'s\\nfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is\\ncalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and\\ngoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the\\nwaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her\\nden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal\\nstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking\\nwith him Grendel\\'s head._\\n\\n_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar\\nliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among\\nthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._\\n\\n_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._\\n\\n_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a\\ndistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._\\n\\n_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he\\nhas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried\\nby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing\\nstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is\\ninexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor\\nthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is\\nburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that\\nsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national\\nhero of Geatland._\\n\\n_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,\\nhis goodness of heart, and his generosity._\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the\\nstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that\\nof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history\\nof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our\\nforefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of\\nadventure.\\n\\nMy special thanks are due to Professors Francis A.

All the war-troop arose then,\\n          \\'Neath the Eagle\\'s Cape sadly betook them,\\n          Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.\\n          They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying,\\n       90 His slaughter-bed holding, him who rings had given them\\n          In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment\\n          Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,\\n          Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.\\n          First they beheld there a creature more wondrous,\\n\\n{They also see the dragon.}\\n\\n       95 The worm on the field, in front of them lying,\\n          The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,\\n          Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,\\n          Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured\\n          Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time[5]\\n      100 To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing\\n          To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,\\n          He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.\\n          There stood round about him beakers and vessels,\\n          Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,\\n      105 With iron-rust eaten, as in earth\\'s mighty bosom\\n          A thousand of winters there they had rested:\\n\\n{The hoard was under a magic spell.}\\n\\n          That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,\\n          Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any\\n          The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,\\n[103] 110 Sooth-king of Vict\\'ries gave whom He wished to\\n\\n{God alone could give access to it.}\\n\\n          [6](He is earth-folk\\'s protector) to open the treasure,\\n          E\\'en to such among mortals as seemed to Him proper.\\n\\n    [1] For \\'góda,\\' which seems a surprising epithet for a Geat to apply\\n    to the \"terrible\" Ongentheow, B. suggests \\'gomela.\\' The passage would\\n    then stand: \\'_The old one went then,\\' etc._\\n\\n    [2] For \\'segn Higeláce,\\' K., Th., and B. propose \\'segn Higeláces,\\'\\n    meaning: _Higelac\\'s banner followed the Swedes (in pursuit)._--S.\\n    suggests \\'sæcc Higeláces,\\' and renders: _Higelac\\'s pursuit._--The\\n    H.-So. reading, as translated in our text, means that the banner of\\n    the enemy was captured and brought to Higelac as a trophy.\\n\\n    [3] The rendering given in this translation represents the king as\\n    being generous beyond the possibility of reproach; but some\\n    authorities construe \\'him\\' (2996) as plu., and understand the passage\\n    to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received\\n    more reward than they were entitled to.\\n\\n    [4] The name \\'Scyldingas\\' here (3006) has caused much discussion, and\\n    given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as\\n    follows: (1) After the downfall of Hrothgar\\'s family, Beowulf was king\\n    of the Danes, or Scyldings. (2) For \\'Scyldingas\\' read\\n    \\'Scylfingas\\'--that is, after killing Eadgils, the Scylfing prince,\\n    Beowulf conquered his land, and held it in subjection. (3) M.\\n    considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053. (Cf. H.-So.)\\n\\n    [5] B. takes \\'nihtes\\' and \\'hwílum\\' (3045) as separate adverbial cases,\\n    and renders: _Joy in the air had he of yore by night, etc_. He thinks\\n    that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed.\\n\\n    [6] The parenthesis is by some emended so as to read: (1) (_He_ (i.e.\\n    _God_) _is the hope of men_); (2) (_he is the hope of heroes_). Gr.\\'s\\n    reading has no parenthesis, but says: ... _could touch, unless God\\n    himself, true king of victories, gave to whom he would to open the\\n    treasure, the secret place of enchanters, etc_. The last is rejected\\n    on many grounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXLII.\\n\\nWIGLAF\\'S SAD STORY.--THE HOARD CARRIED OFF.\\n\\n\\n          Then \\'twas seen that the journey prospered him little\\n          Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden[1]\\n          Down \\'neath the wall.

    "## Part 2: Creating Baseline Language Models 📕\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're able to tokenize a corpus, it is time to start building language models (LM).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build three different language models. They all operate under the premise of assigning probabilities to sentences. Given a sentence – that is, a sequence of tokens $w = w_1\\ldots w_n$ – we want to be able to compute the **probability** that sentence is used: \n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sentences are built from tokens, and the likelihood that a token occurs where it does depends on the tokens before it. This points to using **conditional probability** to compute $P(w)$. That is, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This is also called the **chain rule** for probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Consider the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code>'when I drink Coke I smile'</code></center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The probability that it occurs, according the the chain rule, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I})\\cdot P(\\text{Coke | when I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when I drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | when I drink Coke I})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability that the sentence occurs is the product of the probability that each subsequent token follows the tokens that came before. For example, the probability $P(\\text{Coke | when I drink})$ is likely pretty high, as Coke is something that you drink. The probability $P(\\text{pizza | when I drink})$ is likely low, because pizza is not something that you drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder how the language model \"knows\" that Coke is something that you drink, but pizza is not. The way that the language model \"learns\" its probabilities is by **looking at examples of existing sentences**, i.e. by being **trained on a corpus**. Throughout Parts 2 and 3, you will look at **different ways of estimating these probabilities**. In each case, you will use a corpus to assign probabilities to different tokens and combinations of tokens, and use those probabilities to generate new sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language model you build will be a **class** with a few methods in common:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recap what we've done so far. Recall the chain rule for probability, where $w$ is a sentence made up of tokens $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3 (Uniform) and 4 (Unigram), your `train` methods computed these probabilities **unconditionally**, meaning that the probability that a token appeared in a sentence did **not depend** on the other tokens around it. That is, you said $P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i - 1}) = P(w_i)$. In Question 3, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{1}{\\text{# unique tokens in corpus}}$, and in Question 4, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{\\text{# tokens in corpus equal to $w_i$}}{\\text{# tokens in corpus}}$. Cruciually, each probability was determined by looking at the corpus that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Gram Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will build an N-Gram language model, in which the probability of a token appearing in a sentence **does depend** on the tokens that come before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule above specifies that the probability that a token occurs at in a particular position in a sentence depends on **all** previous tokens in the sentence. However, it is often the case that the likelihood that a token appears in a sentence is influenced more by **nearby** tokens. (Remember, tokens are words, punctuation, or `'\\x02'` / `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Gram language model relies on the assumption that only nearby tokens matter. Specifically, it assumes that the probability that a token occurs depends only on the previous $N-1$ tokens, rather than all previous tokens. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In an N-Gram language model, there is a hyperparameter that we get to choose when creating the model, $N$. For any $N$, the resulting N-Gram model looks at the previous $N-1$ tokens when computing probabilities. (Note that the unigram model you built in Question 4 is really an N-Gram model with $N=1$, since it looked at 0 previous tokens when computing probabilities.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Trigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N=3$, we have a \"trigram\" model. Such a model looks at the previous $N-1 = 2$ tokens when computing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the tuple `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')`, corresponding to the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'`. Under the trigram model, the probability of this sentence is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke | I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | Coke I})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when computing the probability that the sentence ends in `'smile'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Both when working with a training corpus and when implementing the `probability` method to compute the probabilities of other sentences, you will need to work with \"chunks\" of $N$ tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The **N-Grams of a text** are a list of tuples containing sliding windows of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the trigrams in the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'drink'), ('I', 'drink', 'Coke'), ('drink', 'Coke', 'I'), ('Coke', 'I', 'smile')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing N-Gram Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in our trigram model above, we computed $P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile})$ as being the product of several conditional probabilities. These conditional probabilities are the result of **training** our N-Gram model on a training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an N-Gram model, we must compute a conditional probability for every $N$-token sequence in the corpus. For instance, suppose again that we are training a trigram model. Then, for every 3-token sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, we must compute $P(w_3 | w_1, w_2)$. To do so, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",

    "The `NGramLM` class contains a few extra methods and attributes beyond those of `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiating `NGramLM` requires both a list of tokens and a positive integer `N`, specifying the N in N-grams. This parameter is stored in an attribute `N`.\n",
    "    - Assume that `N` is less than or equal to `len(tokens)`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has a method `create_ngrams` that takes in a list of tokens and returns a list of N-Grams (recall from above, an N-Gram is a **tuple** of length N). This list of N-Grams is then passed to the `train` method to train the N-Gram model.\n",
    "1. While the `train` method still creates a language model (in this case, an N-Gram model) and stores it in the `mdl` attribute, this model is most naturally stored as a DataFrame. This DataFrame will have three columns:\n",
    "    - `'ngram'`, containing the N-Grams found in the text.\n",
    "    - `'n1gram'`, containing the (N-1)-Grams upon which the N-Grams in `ngram` are built.\n",
    "    - `'prob'`, containing the probabilities of each N-Gram in `ngram`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has an attribute `prev_mdl` that stores an (N-1)-Gram language model over the same corpus (which in turn will store an (N-2)-Gram language model over the same corpus, and so on). This is necessary to compute the probability that a word occurs at the start of a text. This code is included for you in the constructor."

    "### Question 5.4 – Sampling from the N-Gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='question5d'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method you implemented in the `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM` classes was `sample`, which gave you a way of generating new sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the `sample` method in the `NGramLM` class. It should take in a positive integer `M` and generate a string of M tokens using the trained language model. It should begin with a starting token `'\\x02'`, then generate a subsequent `M-1` tokens from the probabilities in `self.mdl` while continuing to pick words conditioned on the most recent previous choices, lastly a `'\\x03'` token should be added to the end giving a string of `M` tokens (not counting the inital `'\\x02'` token).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate how sampling works using a small concrete example. Suppose our corpus and **trigram** model are defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> short_corpus = 'zebras eat green peas \\n\\n cows eat green grass \\n\\n zebras eat green peppers'\n",
    ">>> short_tokens = tokenize(short_corpus)\n",
    ">>> short_tokens\n",
    "['\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peas', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'cows', 'eat', 'green', 'grass', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peppers', '\\x03']\n",
    ">>> grass_model = NGramLM(3, short_tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are told to execute `grass_model.sample(5)`. Here's how we'd proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. The first character in the output is `'\\x02'`, as specified above. **We won't count this starting `'\\x02'` in the length of our output string**, so we still need to find 5 more tokens.\n",
    "1. The next character needs to be either `'zebras'` or `'cows'`, since `('\\x02', 'zebras')` and `('\\x02', 'cows')` are the only **bigrams** in `short_tokens` that start with an `'\\x02'`. $P(\\text{zebras | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $P(\\text{cows | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we select either `'zebras'` or `'cows'` for our next token according to these probabilities. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'cows'`. 4 more tokens to go.\n",
    "2. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('\\x02', 'cows')`. There is just one, `('\\x02', 'cows', 'eat')`, so our next token must be `'eat'`. 3 more tokens to go.\n",
    "3. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('cows', 'eat')`. Again, there is just one, `('cows', 'eat', 'green')`, so our next token must be `'green'`. 2 more tokens to go.\n",
    "4. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('eat', 'green')`. There are three options – `('eat', 'green', 'peas')`, `('eat', 'green', 'grass')`, and `('eat', 'green', 'peppers')`. Since $P(\\text{peas | eat green}) = P(\\text{grass | eat green}) = P(\\text{peppers | eat green}) = \\frac{1}{3}$, we pick either `'peas'`, `'grass'`, or `'peppers'` uniformly at random. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'peppers'`. 1 more token to go.\n",
    "5. We must end the output string now with `'\\x03'`, putting us at `'\\x02'` plus 5 tokens, which is the number of tokens we were told to sample. Note that `'\\x03'` **does** count towards the number of tokens we were asked to sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our result is `'\\x02 cows eat green peppers \\x03'`, this is 5 tokens excluding the initial `'\\x02'`. **Note that in our training corpus we never encountered an instance of cows 🐄 eating green peppers 🫑, but we were able to generate a coherent sentence in which they did – pretty cool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidance:\n",
    "- Only the initial `'\\x02'` token is not counted for the number of tokens generated, every subsequent `'\\x02'` or `'\\x03'` token you generate will count towards that total (including the mandatory final `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "- If you run into a situation where there are no N-Grams that match the most recent (N-1)-Gram, you should add `'\\x03'` (STOP) token as the next token in your output sentence. There is a chance that your sampled sentence ends in many `'\\x03'`s, and that's fine.\n",
    "- Helper functions and recursion will be very helpful.\n",
    "- You will not be tested for a case where `M` (the number of tokens you should generate) is less than `N` from your ngrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've understood the above example, complete the implementation of the `sample` method in `NGramLM`."
